# React + TypeScript Senior Interview Prep

This repo contains a curated set of **10 handsâ€‘on mini projects** designed to prepare senior frontend engineers for interviews involving **React + TypeScript**. Each project takes roughly **1 hour** and focuses on a critical concept expected of a senior engineer. These challenges emphasize **type safety**, **reusability**, **performance**, **composition**, and **best practices** with modern React.

## ğŸ”§ How to Use This Repo

Each project lives in its own directory under `/projects/`:

```bash
projects/
  01-generic-list/
  02-performance-list/
  03-use-debounce/
  04-tabs-ui/
  05-theme-context/
  06-form-validation/
  07-error-boundary/
  08-testing-suite/
  09-data-fetcher/
  10-polymorphic-button/
```

Inside each folder you will find:

* A **README.md** (the challenge brief)
* Optional **starter code** (when relevant)
* A deliberately failing **test suite** (for testingâ€‘focused projects)
* A **solution** branch with one possible implementation

Clone the repo, check out any project folder, start a timer, and code away.

## ğŸ§­ Suggested Flow

1. Start with **ProjectsÂ 1â€‘3** to reinforce TypeScript fundamentals and hook patterns.
2. Move to **ProjectsÂ 4â€‘6** for component architecture and form handling.
3. Tackle **ProjectsÂ 7â€‘9** to cover robustness, testing, and realâ€‘world data.
4. Finish with **ProjectÂ 10** to cement advanced prop typing and composition.

## ğŸ“Œ General Interview Tips

* **Narrate your thinking.** Interviewers care more about your reasoning than errorâ€‘free typing.
* **Type confidently.** Master generics, utility types, unions, and conditional types.
* **Practice without tools.** Disable autocomplete or linting on a runâ€‘through to mimic whiteboard pressure.
* **Show tradeâ€‘offs.** Senior engineers weigh performance, testability, readability, and flexibility.

## ğŸ§° Requirements

* NodeÂ 18+
* TypeScriptÂ 5+
* ReactÂ 18+
* (Optional per project) React Hook Form, Zod, React Query, Jest, RTL, etc.
